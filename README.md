# Inspiration
Our goal was to create an interactive game/simulator where your input velocity calculates user's trajectory in relation to large masses in the frame.

# What it does
User has options to set initial conditions of launch, and sends them into orbit with the large planet ahead.

# How we built it
We used the Java GUI for all of our programming, using physics formulas to solve for our coordinates at a given frame.

# Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was the time frame and learning curve of new system (Java GUI). We had to adjust our plans to scale down our initial multi-mass system to be able to formulate the mathematical requirements in time.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning the GUI in a weekend! This was such an exciting experience and really pushed us to use all the language has to offer.

# What's next for Sling-Shot Orbit
More inputs! More masses! Now that we have the GUI down, we can go forward with our original ambitious multi-mass system.
